___
one thing i've become more conscious about is the media i interact with every day. although there will be criticism about everything, i try to keep an open mind on pieces and carve my own thoughts on a clean slate.

most of these are recommendations, and i'm always open to more, especially those related to society, civic duty, and the environment :)

> i want to learn new things. why are minority communities disproptionately affected by technology in the medical field? a legit concern. how are languages formed? how did we learn to harness energy from the sun, and if it's been proven to be much more effective than fossil fuels, why haven't we moved to that medium? how are policies created and how are political grounds formed formed? satisfying everyone essentially means satisfying no one, but then how do we determine the basis for the medium ground? how was logic formed? why are there so many things unsolved when we have the tools to solve them? there's so much knowledge in the world but such little time to learn it. - myself

 looking back, i remember feeling hysterical sending this over a discord server past midnight on the last day of the year. my friends were discussing resolutions, a topic that i've dismissed time and time again. being pulled in many different directions in the mere time i've been on earth has taught me only one thing: unpredictability. setting artificial goals at a time of high emotions has not proven successful in motivating me. 
 
 instead, i'm driven by the questions that pound my head every time i open twitter or turn on the evening news. even more so after a tumultuous year, i question why aren't we progressing. the questions i have are being researched, the philosophies i question have been in place for ages, and solutions *are* being found. so why don't i know it? there's a fire burning in me to search for answers, a fire i've been desparately trying to spark for years. i'll use its light to guide me, not over a concept of time but rather the duration of my curiosity.
 
 after waking up the next morning, my body is rested. time to learn.

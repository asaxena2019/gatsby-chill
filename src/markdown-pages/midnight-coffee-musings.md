i want to learn new things. why are minority communities disproptionately affected by technology in the medical field? a legit concern. how are languages formed? how did we learn to harness energy from the sun, and if it's been proven to be much more effective than fossil fuels, why haven't we moved to that medium? how are policies created and how is(are?) politics formed? satisfying everyone = satisfying no one, but then how do we determine the basis for the medium ground? how does logic exist and why does no one use it? why are there so many things unsolved when we have the tools to solve them? there's so much knowledge in the world but such little time to learn it.
